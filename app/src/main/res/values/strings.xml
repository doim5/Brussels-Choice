    <string name="objectivedto">As the name says, your objective in this gamemode is to get from a bigger number down to one. You can try setting highscores for either time or number of moves or both for different given number of digits. </string>
    <string name="objectiveft">"Here you have to find a way to get from one number to another. Time doesn't matter, so minimize the number of operations you do."</string>
    <string name="objectiveatgt">"As in Down To One you have to get to one as fast as possible (wether in terms of time or moves is up to you). But this time the number you multiply and divide by is three!\n\nBe warned: this way it's harder"</string>
